NEW RULES:
You now move with the arrow keys and turn the block with spacebar. You may build rows on any wall. Pieces now start in the middle. If a piece would overlap another piece when it is initially spawned the window is close and the player loses the game. Have fun!

If you want this to compile and run on visual studio.
